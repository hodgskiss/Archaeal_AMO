Locus tags, protein families, and conservationa are based off: Abby SS, Kerou M, Schleper C. "Ancestral reconstructions decipher major adaptations of ammonia-oxidizing archaea upon radiation into moderate terrestrial and marine environments." MBio. 2020;11:e02371â€“20.  DOI: https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.02371-20.

Data was provided through personal communication of the authors.


The candidates for the AMO genes determined from the R scripts, and shown in Table 1(A and B) were checked for conservation and exclusiveness using this list.

N. viennensis genes are supplied in GenBank format using the R script, and must be converted to RefSeq format for the provided list.
GenBank and RefSeq locus tags for N. viennensis (Table_S1) and N. cavascurensis (Table_S2) can be sound in Dataset_S1 within the supplementary information of the manuscript.

Only the gene NVIE_027260 (RefSeq: NVIE_RS16200) is not found in this list.
Therefore, independent PSI-BLAST on the NCBI website was used to verify that it is not found in all AOA and can also be found outside of the AOA clade.
